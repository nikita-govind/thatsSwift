Second Project

*  Design pattern MVC (Model-View-Controller:
   ---------          ---------         --------------         -------
   | DATA  |   <->    | MODEL |  <->    | CONTROLLER |  <->    |VIEW | -> Output on screen
   ---------          ---------         --------------         ------- <- Input to the screen
-- Modular
-- Easy to debug

1. Add a Label <I am rich> to storyboard file
2. Change background color of the main View
3. The positioning origin (0,0) for iOS is top-left corner
* Link to sizes of different iOS devices: http://ios-resolution.com
4. Add an Image View
5. Add images to Assets.xcassets file:
-- Drag and drop asked images inside the dotted holders in AppIcon
(If you name them in the format Icon-20@3x.png i.e. IconeName-pixels@sizex.png, it will auto detect)
==> If you don't fill all the holder, we will get warnings regarding the same when we run the project.
To get rid of this, Project -> General -> Deployment -> toggle from "Universal" to "Iphone"(or iPad, depending on what you are testing)
-- Drag and drop the Main Central image we want below AppIcon in the sidebar

6. Testing on an actual iPhone:
-- Version check:
a. Xcode version xxx.N and iPhone version aaa.N should match is their minorOS versions.
b. If not, set the Deployment version on Xcode project to your iPhone's version (Project -> General -> Deployment Target)

-- Code Signing:
a. Have a unique bundleID (Project -> General -> Identity -> BundleID). Usually com.apple.name.
b. "Automatically manage signing" checked.
c. Under Team -> Add account - your iCloud account and choose your account - will create certificate for you (May take time -a lot of time)

-- 'Sideloading' your app and running on your phone:
a. Connect your iPhone to your machine.
b. In the Xcode scheme dropdown, make sure the correct Device type is selected as your phone type.
Your phone will show up there too. Set destination as "XYZ's iPhone" or Product -> Destination)
c. Run the Project
d. May ask you to unlock your phone, do so.
* If it is unlocked and still throws the same error, hit Shift+Cmd+2(Windows-> Devices). Now right click on your device -> Unpair.
Now it reask for "Trust" or "Don't trust"
* If you have already sideloaded many apps, Apple may not allow you to sideload more. Then delete apps: Shift+Cmd+2 -> Choose your device -> Delete some installed apps
Now reconnect your iPhone again. iTunes will open and ask you to Trust the machine on your iPhone. Hit Trust and try running the project now. 
e. Keychain may ask you to enter login password many times, do so and hit "Always allow"
f. You will see the app on the iPhone. Try to launch it, it says "Not trusted". Settings -> Device Management -> Select your app -> Trust this app
g. Run again. Wohoo!
