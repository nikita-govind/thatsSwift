Second Project

*  Design pattern MVC (Model-View-Controller:
   ---------          ---------         --------------         -------
   | DATA  |   <->    | MODEL |  <->    | CONTROLLER |  <->    |VIEW | -> Output on screen
   ---------          ---------         --------------         ------- <- Input to the screen
-- Modular
-- Easy to debug

1. Add a Label <I am rich> to storyboard file
2. Change background color of the main View
3. The positioning origin (0,0) for iOS is top-left corner
* Link to sizes of different iOS devices: 
4. Add an Image View
5. Add images to Assets file:
-- Drag and drop asked images inside the dotted holders in AppIcon
==> If you don't fill all the holder, we will get warnings on the same when we run the project.
To get rid of this, Project -> General -> Deployment -> toggle from "Universal" to "Iphone"
-- Drag and drop the Main Central image we want below AppIcon in the sidebar
